In this project, Samitha Herath ang Fangfang Zhang will discover some interesting things in the "Popular Baby Names" [dataset](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/popular-baby-names). This dataset consist of the popular baby names by sex and ethnic group from 2011 to 2019. Each row represents one baby's name. There are 6 columns, `Year of Birth`, it is quantitative and indicates the year of the baby birth; `Year of Birth` includes year from 2011 to 2019; `Gender`, it is categorical variable (Male and Female); `Ethnicity` is a categorical variable and it indicates the mother's ethnicity; `Child.s.First.Name` is a categorical variable, it represents baby's first name; `Count` is quantitative and the value represents the frequency of names were collected through civil birth registration; and `Rank` is the ranking of each baby's name.

We want to see the top 10 popular first names in each ethnic group and each gender; if there is a difference in the average letters of the names between male and female and are there any trend in the mean length of names over time; and if different ethnic groups have preferences for baby's names? Are there names that have consistently remained popular over several years or decades? Are there any noticeable spikes in the popularity of names related to popular culture, such as movie characters or celebrities?
