In this project, Samitha Herath ang Fangfang Zhang will discover some interesting things in the "Popular Baby Names" [dataset](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/popular-baby-names). This dataset consist of the popular baby names by sex and ethnic group from 2011 to 2019. Each row represents one baby's name. There are 6 columns, `Year of Birth`, it is quantitative and indicates the year of the baby birth; `Year of Birth` includes year from 2011 to 2019; `Gender`, it is categorical variable (Male and Female); `Ethnicity` is a categorical variable and it indicates the mother's ethnicity; `Child.s.First.Name` is a categorical variable, it represents baby's first name; `Count` is quantitative and the value represents the frequency of names were collected through civil birth registration; and `Rank` is the ranking of each baby's name.

We want to see the popular first names in each ethnic group and each gender; if there is a difference in the mean length (the average number of letters of names) between male and female; is there an increasing/decreasing trend in the average length of babies' first names over time; and if different ethnic groups have preferences for baby's names?
