## Instructions

Each member of your team should modify this document in some way and push their modifications to the repository in a separate commit. This will ensure that you have set your repository up in a way that ensures all group members are working with the same repository.

Please ensure that you have set your git name and email address on your computer by **modifying** the following commands and running them in the terminal:

```         
git config --global user.name "Mona Lisa"
git config --global user.email "mona@lisa.com"
```

In the proposal as in the final report, all of your code chunks should be set so that `echo = F`, which prevents the code from being printed in the report. You should also set `message = F, warning = F`, which will reduce the amount of additional output which is present in the report. You can customize the execution of code in quarto by using additional options, some of which are detailed [here](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/execution-options.html).

## Data

### Source

The data we are using in this project comes from \[https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/popular-baby-names\].

If you cannot link directly to the data file, then you need to additionally describe how someone could acquire the same data:

> You can download the data directly using \[https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/Popular-Baby-Names/25th-nujf\].

This link is NYC OpenData, you can easily access the dataset and view the short description of it.

Provide some code to read in the data (either stored in the repository or read in directly from the source).

```{r warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
data_url <- "https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/views/25th-nujf/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD"
data <- read.csv(data_url)

# if you want to see the first several rows of this data set, use the following code
head(data)
```

### Description

This data set contains information about the popularity of baby names categorized by gender and ethnic group. Each entry indicates the ranking of a name based on its frequency, providing insights into the relative popularity of each name.

It was obtained from official civil birth registration records.

Here is a data dictionary showing each variable, the type of variable, units, and range of values that are possible:

| Name               | Description                                                            | Type        | Units | Range/Values                                                                                                                 |

## Project Goals

Describe why this data is interesting and what you hope to do with it.

We will use \[Popular_Baby_Names\] to explore the following topics:

-   What are the top 10 popular first names in each gender? in each ethnic groups? Are there any similarities?
-   Are there any trends (increasing, decreasing, or no change) in the average length of babies' first names over time?
-   Are there names that have consistently remained popular over several years or decades?
-   How does the ranking (rank) of a name change over time?
-   A possible questions we might be able to answer is, are there any noticeable spikes in the popularity of names related to popular culture, such as movie characters or celebrities?

We expect to create/calculate

-   a histogram/bargraph/line graph to show the frequency of each name based on the year, ethnic group and gender.
-   the average length of names for male and female (or different ethnic groups)
-   a time plot to show the trend of the average length of popular names in different genders
-   Graphical Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) method to explore the data set and understand the underlying trends and characteristics.
-   we can try to find any correlations of names with variables like gender and ethnicity.

## Division of Labor

We will divide the objectives into two halves. Each team member is expected to complete their proportion of the project by November 11 or one week earlier. The report should be finalized by November 18. As long as you are coding, you are also expected to write the draft of this project.

Additionally, we also need to set a small weekly objectives to monitor our progress. To enhance the communication, we will use student mail and Canvas. Finally, we will our individuals contributes to complete the report and presentation. The presentation is expected to be done by November 25.

*Note: we are expected to complete our tasks one week ahead of the due date because we have differing schedules. This adjustment is necessary to accommodate any potential time conflicts.*

## Additional Comments

We have two question about what we are going to investigate but finally we figure it out.
