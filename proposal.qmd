## Instructions

Each member of your team should modify this document in some way and push their modifications to the repository in a separate commit. This will ensure that you have set your repository up in a way that ensures all group members are working with the same repository.

Please ensure that you have set your git name and email address on your computer by **modifying** the following commands and running them in the terminal:

```         
git config --global user.name "Mona Lisa"
git config --global user.email "mona@lisa.com"
```

In the proposal as in the final report, all of your code chunks should be set so that `echo = F`, which prevents the code from being printed in the report. You should also set `message = F, warning = F`, which will reduce the amount of additional output which is present in the report. You can customize the execution of code in quarto by using additional options, some of which are detailed [here](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/execution-options.html).

## Data

### Source

The data we are using in this project comes from \[https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/popular-baby-names\].

If you cannot link directly to the data file, then you need to additionally describe how someone could acquire the same data:

> You can download the data directly using \[https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/Popular-Baby-Names/25th-nujf\].

This link is NYC OpenData, you can easily access the dataset and view the short description of it.

Provide some code to read in the data (either stored in the repository or read in directly from the source).

```{r warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
data_url <- "https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/views/25th-nujf/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD"
data <- read.csv(data_url)

# if you want to see the first several rows of this data set, use the following code
head(data)
```

### Description

This data set contains information about ...

It was collected from ...

Here is a data dictionary showing each variable, the type of variable, units, and range of values that are possible:

Note: this is an example table, please modify to actually match your data. Ensure that all of the same information is represented.

## Project Goals

Describe why this data is interesting and what you hope to do with it.

We will use \[Popular_Baby_Names\] to explore the following topics:

-   What are the popular first names in each ethnic group, and each gender?
-   Is there a difference in the length of the names between male and female?
-   "Are there any trends (increasing, decreasing, or no change) in the length of babies' first names over time?"
-   Do different ethnic groups have preferences for names?

We expect to create

-   a histogram/bargraph/line graph to show the frequency of each name based on the year, ethnic group and gender.
-   may need to calculate the average length of names for male and female (or different ethnic groups)
-   may use statistical model to see if there is a difference between male and female
-   Graphical Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) method description of
-   may use a time plot to show the trend of the popular names over time
-   

## Division of Labor

We will divide the objectives into two halves. Each team member is expected to complete their proportion of the project by November 11 or one week earlier. The report should be finalized by November 18. As long as you are coding, you are also expected to write the draft of this project.

Additionally, we also need to set a small weekly objectives to monitor our progress. To enhance the communication, we will use student mail and Canvas. Finally, we will our individuals contributes to complete the report and presentation. The presentation is expected to be done by November 25.

*Note: we are expected to complete our tasks one week ahead of the due date because we have differing schedules. This adjustment is necessary to accommodate any potential time conflicts.*

## Additional Comments

Is it appropriate to use a hypothesis testing in our project regarding the mean length of names between male and female? We plan to perform a T test to show what we find. We can also use graph to display and explain it. The graphing method is obvious to see the result but we are considering to use a hypothesis testing to prove or disprove the difference.
